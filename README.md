# Cancer Patient Outcome Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Course Information
- **Course**: ECE-UY 4563 Introduction to Machine Learning
- **Institution**: New York University
- **Semester**: Fall 2024
- **Instructor**: Prof. Sundeep Rangan

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting cancer patient outcomes through binary survival classification using various machine learning approaches. We implemented and compared the performance of three different models:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network

## Team Members
- Hongtai Du (hd2609@nyu.edu)
- Daniel Yang (ty2184@nyu.edu)

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Due to data privacy and usage agreements, the sample dataset cannot be shared on GitHub.

## Models and Analysis
We conducted a comparative analysis of three machine learning models:
1. Logistic Regression - A baseline model for binary classification
2. Support Vector Machine - For potentially better handling of non-linear relationships
3. Neural Network - To capture complex patterns in the data

The performance metrics and detailed analysis of each model can be found in the project documentation.
